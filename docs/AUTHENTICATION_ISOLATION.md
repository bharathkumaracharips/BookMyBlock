# BookMyBlock - Authentication Isolation

## Problem Solved
Previously, all three dashboards (User, Admin, Owner) were sharing the same authentication state and cached credentials, causing login conflicts between dashboards.

## Solution Implemented
Each dashboard now has completely isolated authentication systems:

### Separate Storage Keys
- **User Dashboard**: `privy:user:session`
- **Admin Dashboard**: `privy:admin:session`  
- **Owner Dashboard**: `privy:owner:session`

### Separate API Endpoints
- **User Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000/api`
- **Admin Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8001/api`
- **Owner Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8002/api`

### Separate Environment Configurations
Each dashboard has its own `.env.local` file with dashboard-specific settings.

## How It Works

1. **Independent Sessions**: Each dashboard maintains its own authentication session in localStorage
2. **No Cross-Contamination**: Login in one dashboard doesn't affect others
3. **Separate User Bases**: Each dashboard can have different users logged in simultaneously
4. **Isolated Credentials**: Cached credentials are stored separately for each dashboard

## Testing Authentication Isolation

### Clear Authentication Data
```javascript
// In browser console for each dashboard:

// User Dashboard (localhost:3000)
localStorage.removeItem('privy:user:session')

// Admin Dashboard (localhost:3001)  
localStorage.removeItem('privy:admin:session')

// Owner Dashboard (localhost:3002)
localStorage.removeItem('privy:owner:session')
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Login to User Dashboard** → Should not affect Admin/Owner
2. **Login to Admin Dashboard** → Should not affect User/Owner  
3. **Login to Owner Dashboard** → Should not affect User/Admin
4. **Logout from one** → Others remain logged in
5. **Different users** → Can be logged into different dashboards simultaneously

## Utility Functions

Each dashboard includes utility functions for clearing auth data:

```typescript
// User Dashboard
import { clearUserAuth } from './utils/auth'
clearUserAuth()

// Admin Dashboard  
import { clearAdminAuth } from './utils/auth'
clearAdminAuth()

// Owner Dashboard
import { clearOwnerAuth } from './utils/auth'
clearOwnerAuth()
```

## Environment Variables

Each dashboard uses its own environment configuration:

```bash
# User Dashboard (.env.local)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
VITE_DASHBOARD_TYPE=user

# Admin Dashboard (.env.local)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/api  
VITE_DASHBOARD_TYPE=admin

# Owner Dashboard (.env.local)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8002/api
VITE_DASHBOARD_TYPE=owner
```

## Benefits

✅ **No Login Conflicts** - Each dashboard has independent authentication  
✅ **Separate User Sessions** - Different users can be logged into different dashboards  
✅ **Isolated Storage** - No shared localStorage keys between dashboards  
✅ **Independent APIs** - Each dashboard connects to its own backend  
✅ **Easy Testing** - Can test all dashboards simultaneously without interference
