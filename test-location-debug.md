# Location Debug Test

## Current Issue
The LocationService is correctly detecting the location (Hyderabad, pincode 500001) but the frontend is not updating to show this location.

## Debug Steps

1. **LocationService is working**: ✅
   - Successfully detects coordinates: `{latitude: 17.49213033812965, longitude: 78.39883007747474}`
   - Successfully geocodes to: `{city: 'Hyderabad', state: 'Telangana', pincode: '500001'}`

2. **LocationFinder component**: ❓
   - Calls `LocationService.getCurrentLocation()` correctly
   - Should call `setGlobalLocation(location)` with the detected location
   - Need to verify if this is happening

3. **LocationContext**: ❓
   - Should receive the location update via `setUserLocation`
   - Should update the global state
   - Need to verify if this is happening

4. **HomePage component**: ❓
   - Should receive the updated location via `useLocationContext()`
   - Should display the new location
   - Need to verify if this is happening

## Expected Flow
1. User clicks "Use current location" button
2. LocationFinder calls `getCurrentLocation()`
3. LocationService detects location and returns it
4. LocationFinder calls `setGlobalLocation(location)`
5. LocationContext updates global state
6. HomePage re-renders with new location
7. useLocationTheaters hook fetches theaters/events for new location

## Test Plan
1. Add more detailed logging to each step
2. Verify that each function is being called
3. Check for any React state update issues
4. Test with a simple manual location update
